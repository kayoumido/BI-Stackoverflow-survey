# Final report

_Are there any differences in the technologies used by female and male developers ?_

## Introduction

## Methods

All the dataset I used are the results of the annual survey [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) does. Which I found on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/).

The dataset is quite large (~60k entries) and contains enough data to do multiple analysis e.g. What is the most used technology used in each country ? etc....

## Results

Before directly comparing the differences between men and women i thought it would be interesting to see what were the most used technologies in general.

As you can see the most used technologies are JavaScript, Git and Agile.

Then I wondered was the proportions of men and women that answered the survey.

We can clearly see that there is a huge difference.

Well apart from the huge differences in numbers, we can see that there aren't any differences.

## Conclusions

Honestly I didn't what to expect. I knew that the amount of women working in development was extremely small, but still surprised when I saw the graph and think they .

The main problem I had when working on this assignment was that I had too much choice in the analysis I could do.
