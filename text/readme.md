#Â Differences in the technologies used by male and female developers

## Introduction
As a developer (junior) myself I always was fascinated by the rate at which the technologies evolved. Over the years the things I learnt when I started my studies in IT are now deprecated and I had to adapt. The other thing that intrigued me was the amount of women studying IT, which is close the none...

I then wondered if there were any differences between the tools and technologies used by men and women (hence my question duh..). I doubt that there is going to be any big differences but you never know ?

## Methods

To answer my question (questions?) I used the results of [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) annual survey which I found on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/).

I roughly went trough the dataset (it's quite large...~60k entries) to see if I could find the information I needed and if it needed to be processed. There is so much information in the dataset I kept changing my original question, but in the end I found what I was looking for and stuck with my original question.

## Results
Before diving into answering of my initial question, I judged/found it important to what, in general, were the most used technologies. So I mage a graph...

And as you can clearly see, the top 3 technologies are JavaScript, Git and Agile.

Then I got curious and wondered what was the proportion of women who answered the survey. Guess what ? I made a graph for it too :D

Not to my surprise the difference is astronomical.

And finally I did a graph to see the differences between men and women.

Apart from the massive difference in numbers, we can see that differences are minim.

## Conclusion
