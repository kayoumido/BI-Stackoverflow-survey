## Raw data
For this analysis the raw data was retrieved on kaggle.com and can be found in the [raw](/raw/) folder.

| URI                                                   | Description                                                               | Date       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017   | List with the results from the survey and the questions that were asked.  | 22 12 2017 |

## Processed data
The processed data can be found in the processed [folder](processed/). You will find two csv files.
| CSV                           | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| extracted_technologies.csv    | This file contains the different technologies used by the developers that filled the survey.  |
| survey_results_clean.csv      | This file contains pretty much the same as its raw version the only difference being is that the used technologies are removed from it. |

 * [Processed data](processed/readme.md)
 * File should be named so it is easy to see which [script](../code/) has generated the data
 * Processed data should be [tidy](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)

## Study design
The data was found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). There is a wide range of dataset that can be found on kaggle. Which is, in my opinion a good platform to find open data.
