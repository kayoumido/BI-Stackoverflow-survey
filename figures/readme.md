# figures

All the graphs were generated using [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) which you can see in `figures.pbix`. But since it's a paid application :wink: and it's only available on windows :disappointed:, the graphs were exported to png format.

## Exploratory Figures

In the [exploratory](exploratory) folder you'll find all the graphs that were generated once I finished messing around with power BI looking for a good graph.

## Final Figures

In the [final](final) folder you'll find the graphs I judged good for the final report and presentation.
